The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" as the first episode of the series.

Former showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss produced the remaining two; they produced the two episodes with the staff of The Critic, the show they left The Simpsons to create. This was done in order to relieve some of the stress The Simpsons' writing staff endured, as they felt that producing 25 in one season was too much. The episode \"A Star Is Burns\" caused some controversy among the staff with Matt Groening removing his name from the episode's credits as he saw it as blatant advertising for The Critic, which was airing at the time. Fox moved The Simpsons back to its original Sunday night time, having aired on Thursdays for the previous four seasons. It has remained in this slot ever since.

In addition to the large Simpsons cast, many guest stars appeared in season ten, including Phil Hartman in his last appearance before his death.\n\nThe season, which won the Annie Award for \"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Program\", has been cited by several critics as the beginning of the series' decline in quality.
